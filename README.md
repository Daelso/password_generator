# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description:
This homework was to create a password generator using only javascript prompts/inputs.

This helped me learn a lot about how to work with prompts/confirms as well as how they interact with if statements/conditionals. I learned that for some reason confirm functions will only work correctly with == true and not === true. Not sure why yet, but looking into it!

I had to google a good bit to find references/resources on making this, namely, the loop that would generate the password randoml. My source for this loop can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1349404/generate-random-string-characters-in-javascript
